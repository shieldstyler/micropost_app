<h1>Micropost</h1>
<h3>An information network</h3>

<p>
Micropost is a real-time information network that connects you to the latest stories, ideas, opinions and news about what you find interesting. Simply find the accounts you find most compelling and follow the conversations.
</p>

<p>
At the heart of Micropost are small bursts of information called Posts. Each Post is 140 characters long, but don't let the small size fool you, you can discover a lot in a little space. You can see photos, videos and conversations directly in Posts to get the whole story at a glance, and all in one place. See it in action.
